# BMGF
 Example usages of Bayesian moment-generating function (BMGF) methods for model marginalisation and marginal likelihood calculation. 
 
 This repository currently contains two scripts: one for Poisson likelihoods and one for gamma likelihoods. There are four examples in the Poisson-likelihood script (three of which are in the paper), and three examples in the gamma-likelihood script.
